Occasionally, the LCD screen would go blank while using the linear actuators.  It has been determined that this is due to electromagnetic interference (EMI).  The MOSFET half-bridge driver requires a PWM signal in order to turn on the top MOSFET. This results in high-current switching causing lots of EMI.  This EMI is picked up by the LCD wiring, occasionally causing the LCD to go blank.

To fix this issue, simply run the LCD wires through a ferrite bead.
